 Bank Loan Analysis with Power BI
Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis repository! This project leverages Power BI to deliver dynamic visualizations and actionable insights into bank loan data, supporting strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

🧭 Project Overview
This analytical solution explores multiple dimensions of bank lending activity. It is structured around three interactive dashboards—Summary, Overview, and Details—each designed to uncover trends, assess loan performance, and evaluate borrower behavior.

📌 Dashboard Breakdown

- Funded Amounts: Total disbursed funds, MTD totals, and MoM changes
- Received Payments: Total repayments from borrowers, including MTD and MoM tracking
- Interest Rate: Average interest rate across all loans, with MTD and MoM analysis
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Average borrower DTI, including MTD and MoM trends
